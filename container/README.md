## Run
Tell how to run the container on Helios and explain that they have acess to there home where their code should be.
Maybe a quick exemple on how to run some code.

## Update
Explain that all the dependencies whould be in the container but if you need to add some you need to copy the container image in their home, start it with `--writable` install what you need and then use the container in non writable in the future.
