# Disk Usage
For this course, you will have access to shared drives to collaborate on as well as your own personal drives.

## Personal Drives
Your personal drives, i.e. `$HOME` and `$SCRATCH` have a capacity of 500 GB.

## Shared Drives
Your team will have access to shared drives on which you will have "unlimited" storage space. Here you can share models, code, data, etc. within your team. We ask you to be mindful with how much space you actually use. We may ask you to reduce your memory footprint in some cases.

All shared drives will be in:

`/project/cq-training-1/project1/shared/`
`/project/cq-training-1/project2/shared/`

We ask you, for each project, to create a directory called `teamN` where N is the team number you will be assigned for the project. N=00 is reserved for the TAs as an example. Be sure to set the appropriate permissions to your folders. We ask that you have a single directory per team inside the `shared` folder. Inside the directory, you will be able to create as many subdirectories as you'd like.

Your folder structure should look something like this:

```
/project/cq-training-1/
└── project1
    └── shared
        └── team00
            └── ...
            └── ...
            └── ...
```
