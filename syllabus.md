## Course Description
This is a course about applying machine learning theory to complex projects. Students will mainly focus on understanding a problem along with the available data and defining machine learning solutions that yield high performance. They will also acquire knowledge specific to software development for machine learning projects such as writing high-quality code and readable documentation in Python, and using collaborative tools and machine learning libraries. Finally, students will develop their (oral and written) communication skills by preparing reports and presentations explaining the solutions they developed and the results they obtained.

### Course structure
Throughout the course, the students will work on two different applied projects in teams of 4 students. Each project will have a total duration of 6 weeks. At the end of each project, each team will hand in their code, best model, and project report. Each team will also be expected to present their work in front of other students.

### Instruction Style
Tutorials will be presented during the first two weeks of the course, as well at specific times during the semester. The remaining class time will be used by students to work on the projects. The TAs will be available during classes to support the students. It is expected that the students will continue to work on the projects outside of class hours.

### Evaluation
For each of the two class projects, the 4 deliverables from each team (code, best model, report and presentation) will be evaluated by the TAs and will contribute towards the project's group grade. 

A student's individual grade for a project will be based on the group grade with a small adjustment based on peer evaluations. A student who contributed more than his fair share may receive an slighly bonified grade while a student who did not do much might receive a slighly lower grade. Please refer to the [full evaluation grid](https://github.com/mila-udem/ift6759/blob/master/evaluation-grid.pdf) for a complete explanation of the evaluation process.

### Class Schedule
The course begins on January 8th and finishes on April 17th.

### Class hours:
- Wednesday: 14:30-16:30 (Mila Agora)
- Friday: 9:30-11:30 (Mila Auditorium #2)

### Office Hours
To be determined

### GPU Computing Resources
Class students will have access to an external GPU cluster to work on their projects. However, this cluster will be shared with other users outside of the course. During the following periods, a set of GPUs will be reserved for the students in the class : 
- Wednesdays from 11h30 to 19h30
- Fridays from 8h30 to 16h30

Outside of those reserved periods, GPUs on the cluster will be accessible on a "first-come, first-served" basis.

### Policy on Contribution

Working in a team is a fundamental part of the professional life of data scientists. By working in a team, you can achieve greater things by contributing to a common project, getting answers to hard questions, being able to brainstorm on new ideas, etc. However, it is not always easy to be part of a team because we do not choose our colleagues; we may have different points of view, different techniques and different skills. Nevertheless, when people in a team are motivated to work towards a common goal, there are different ways to organize the work so that everyone can contribute. Doing so requires a set of interpersonal skills that are not trivial and that you will develop throughout your career.

Now, as we will not tolerate any plagiarism, we will not tolerate that a student is relying solely on others to complete the course. If you think that someone in your team is not contributing at all, start by having a team meeting to discuss with the person on how she/he can contribute. Use a positive and respectful attitude and try to help the person find a way to contribute. As an example, if the person is lacking programming skills, try to organize programming sessions in pairs where one person is programming and the other one is verifying the code, asking questions and making recommendations.

If you think the person is not contributing on purpose, send an email to the TAs. After receiving the email, we will schedule a meeting with all team members so that everyone can discuss their point of view.  Everyone should be able to justify their position with some relevant material (code, report, emails, etc.). Finally, the TAs and the professors will take actions to resolve the problem.
